== Petster ==

Have you ever come up with the perfect strategy to beat a pet battle trainer, only to completely forget it the next time you come to face them? Never again! Petster allows you to define team compositions and battle strategies, and will guide you through them step-by-step as the fight progresses. You can also import strategies from other players, or export your own!
